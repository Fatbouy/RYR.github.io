# First Day of Blogging

Took me long enough to start blogging given that I love to read, write and speak a lot. I guess I didn't take it seriously enough to go through the whole process of building a blog site which is why it took long.

But 20 years after accessing the internet for the first time is a very long time to sit around reading blogs and doing nothing about it. Lazy AF!

Anyway hope this starts a good run in me for blogs. Cheers to the future!
